### ‚úÖ Step 2: Restore the Database

You can restore the database using either a `.bak` backup file or a SQL script.

#### **Method 1: Using Backup File (`AgriEnergyConnectDB2.bak`)**

1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
2. Connect to your SQL Server instance (e.g., `.\SQLEXPRESS` or `localhost`).
3. Right-click on **Databases** > **Restore Database...**.
4. Select **Device** > Click `...` > Add the `AgriEnergyConnectDB2.bak` file.
5. Click **OK** to restore.

#### **Method 2: Using the SQL Script**

1. In SSMS, connect to your server and click **New Query**.
2. Open the SQL script provided in the repo (e.g., `database script.sql`).
3. Execute the script to create and populate the database.
4. Confirm that the `AgriEnergyConnectDB2` database appears in your databases list.

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Update the Connection String

1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Navigate to the `appsettings.json` file.
3. Replace the existing connection string with your actual server name:

   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=AgriEnergyConnectDB2;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"
     }
   }
   ```
4. For local setup, your server might be:

   * `.\SQLEXPRESS`
   * `localhost`
   * or your machine name (e.g., `DESKTOP-1234\SQLEXPRESS`)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Run the Application

1. In Visual Studio, press **F5** or click the green ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Start** button.
2. The application will run at:
   `https://localhost:7171` (port may vary)

### üîç Troubleshooting
- **Connection issues?** Verify:
  - SQL Server is running (check via SSMS)
  - Your connection string matches your server name
  - The database name is exactly `AgriEnergyConnectDB2`
- **Missing dependencies?** Ensure:
  - .NET 8 SDK is installed (`dotnet --list-sdks` in terminal)
  - NuGet packages are restored (right-click solution ‚Üí "Restore NuGet Packages")
   
## Application Flow and User Roles
The application has three roles:

### Admin
- Creates Employee and Farmer roles
- Creates Employee accounts with login credentials
- Manage Employee profiles through Admin portal

### Employee
- Logs in with provided credentials
- Can add new farmers and manage their profiles
- Views and filters products added by farmers

### Farmer
- Logs in with credentials created by an Employee
- Can add products with details
- Can view their own product list
